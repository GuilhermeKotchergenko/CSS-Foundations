# CSS-Foundations

In this lesson, I'm going to focus on what The Odin Project believe are some foundational CSS concepts, things that everyone should know from the beginning â€” whether they are just starting out or simply need a refresher.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of this lesson, I should be able to:

Add styles to HTML with CSS.
Understand how to use the class and ID attributes.
Add styles to specific elements using the correct selectors.
Understand what the cascade does.
